## Quick Start
1) Clone or download this repo.
2) Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
   - On Windows you can double‚Äëclick the file or run:
```bash
start index.html
```
3) You‚Äôre done. No build step, no tooling required.

Optional: Use a lightweight static server for better history/navigation support.
```bash
npx serve .
```

## Features
- Purchased item UX
  - Purchased items are visually muted, moved to the bottom, and show a red ‚ÄúPurchased‚Äù button.
- Views and sorting
  - Under $20, $30 Items, By Priority (S/A/B/C), By Project, Purchased.
  - Projects are sorted by available item count.
- Project detail pages
  - Clean header with name, description, and stats (Total / Available / Purchased).
- Dynamic favicon/vendor handling
  - Item links and vendor badges are consistent and robust.
- Mobile‚Äëfirst, responsive UI
  - 2‚Äëcolumn project layout on small screens, fluid grids elsewhere.
- Fast client‚Äëside router
  - Hash‚Äëfree navigation using `history.pushState`, with full Back/Forward support.
- Secret admin area
  - 5 taps on the gift hero icon ‚Üí password `secret` ‚Üí add/update/delete items and projects.
- Persistence
  - Primary: JSONBin (cloud) via REST; Fallback: `localStorage` (offline‚Äësafe).
- Sound effects (tasteful, low volume)
  - Category tap: Mario; Admin enter: Zelda secret; Purchase confirm: Zelda chest.
- Static landing page
  - The landing markup is pre‚Äërendered; JavaScript only updates dynamic counts/pills, so there‚Äôs no post‚Äëload layout shift.

## Data Model
Items and projects live in JSON. The app reads/writes to JSONBin and mirrors data to `localStorage`.

### Item
```json
{
  "id": "FLIR-ONE-Gen-3",
  "title": "FLIR ONE Gen 3 - Thermal Imaging Camera for iOS Smartphones",
  "price": 204,
  "project": "home-improvement",
  "rank": "S",
  "vendor": "Amazon",
  "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ggGSZaK+L._AC_SL1500_.jpg",
  "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPXX7P5M/...",
  "purchased": false
}
```

### Project
```json
{
  "id": "home-improvement",
  "name": "Home Improvement",
  "description": "House upgrades, tools, and lighting that push back the entropy gremlins.",
  "icon": "üõ†Ô∏è",
  "color": "#EAB308",
  "project-icon-image": "https://...optional-large-image.png"
}
```

## Routing and Navigation
- Routes are stored in `?route=...` and managed with `history.pushState`.
- Core API
  - `nav(route)` ‚Üí navigates and renders
  - `render()` ‚Üí re‚Äërenders current route
- Containers
  - `#home-content` is static HTML for the landing page.
  - `#route-view` is where routed pages render. It remains hidden while on `home`.

## Admin Area (Secret)
- Access: tap the hero gift icon 5 times ‚Üí enter password `secret`.
- Tabs: Items | Projects.
  - Items: add with fields Name, Price, Vendor, Project, Rank (S/A/B/C), Image URL, Item URL, Purchased.
  - Projects: add with fields Name, Description, Icon, Color, Project Icon Image URL.
- Persistence
  - Saves to JSONBin (PUT) and mirrors to `localStorage`.
  - If JSONBin is unreachable, changes still persist locally until connectivity returns.

Security note: This is a static SPA; the JSONBin key is client‚Äëside by design. For sensitive use, proxy requests through a tiny backend.

## Development Guide
- Stack: plain HTML/CSS/JS, no framework.
- Entry points
  - `index.html` ‚Üí static layout and pre‚Äërendered home
  - `app.js` ‚Üí state, router, rendering, admin, sounds
- Key functions
  - `load()` ‚Üí fetches JSONBin, heals missing projects, persists to localStorage
  - `save()` ‚Üí writes to JSONBin and localStorage
  - `nav(to)` / `render()` ‚Üí routing and view rendering
  - `home()` ‚Üí updates dynamic counts and attaches home interactions
- Sounds
  - Implemented with `new Audio(file)`. Default volume is set low for comfort.

### Local Editing Flow
1) Open `index.html` in your browser.
2) Make changes to `app.js` or styles as needed.
3) Refresh to see results. No build step required.

## Troubleshooting
- Landing page flashes or shifts after load
  - Ensure `<body class="home-page">` and that `#route-view` exists right after `#home-content` in `index.html`.
- Back button doesn‚Äôt navigate
  - Verify the browser allows history updates on `file://` URLs. Using a static server (`npx serve .`) provides the best experience.
- Images show broken icons
  - Broken image URLs are gracefully swapped for a placeholder. Verify the remote URL or add a local image.
- JSONBin write fails
  - The app falls back to localStorage. Check network and JSONBin key/URL in `app.js` (`API_URL`, `KEY`).

## Roadmap
- Edit existing items/projects via inline modals
- Import/export data as a downloadable JSON file
- Optional authentication for admin
- Accessibility polish and keyboard shortcuts
